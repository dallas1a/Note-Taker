# Note Taker

This app allows a user to create and save notes in an organized manner. Each card contains a title and a description and user input creates those, a user can add notes or save a note after input has been entered. 

This app uses Node.js and express to use back-end functions to fill the front-end layout. JSON helps by moving data along and saving the data to the console. Every time a new note is added to the db array, the db that the program takes from is updated and shows a new array. A save option is only shown when there has been text in the card from user input. I ommited the delete function but if I were to add it, the card would be deleted based on id and removed from the db array. 

I deployed this project using Heroku CLI and github.
